# Intent-Verified Agentic Workflow Engine

## Overview
This project demonstrates a multi-step agentic workflow system where every autonomous AI action is **declared, verified, and audited on-chain** before execution using the Icarus workflow model.

## Architecture
- Natural Language Interface
- LLM-based Agent Orchestrator
- Intent Generation Module
- On-chain Intent Verification (Smart Contracts)
- Execution Engine
- Icarus Workflow Viewer

## Key Features
- Intent verification before action execution
- On-chain auditability
- Policy, permission, and budget enforcement
- Explainable and compliant AI automation

## Tech Stack
- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- Python (Agent Orchestration)
- Weil SDK / Icarus (Workflow Visualization)

## Status
Prototype / Concept Implementation
